/*
IMPORTANT: To fix the permissions error, you must apply these updated rules:

1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to Firestore Database
4. Click on the "Rules" tab
5. Replace the existing rules with these rules
6. Click "Publish"

These permissive rules are for development only. For production,
you would implement proper authentication and more restrictive rules.
